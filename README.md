## 🕹️ Features

### 🧠 The AI Bartender (GenAI Core)
*   **Abstract Transcription**: Transform abstract prompts like *"Tokyo Rain"* or *"Neon Moonlight"* into precise, ingredient-driven recipes.
*   **Gemini 2.0 Powered**: Leverages the latest Gemini models for nuanced flavor profile analysis and poetic descriptions.
*   **Atomic Decomposition**: Every AI recipe is parsed into discrete, system-standard actions (pours, shakes, stirs) for a 1:1 simulation experience.

### 🥃 High-Fidelity Physics Simulator
*   **Pixel-Perfect Fluid Dynamics**: A custom-built SVG simulation engine that mimics liquid behavior with a "stepped" pixel-art aesthetic.
*   **Interactive Workbench**: Manual mixing mode where you control every drop. Add ice, shake for intensity, or garnish with blocky delicacies.
*   **Flavor Analytics**: Real-time feedback on your drink's profile—Sweet, Sour, Bitter, Spicy, Boozy, and Salty.

### 📼 Cyber-Retro UI/UX
*   **CRT Aesthetics**: Integrated scanline effects, coordinate grids, and technical overlays for a 1980s lab feel.
*   **Technical Telemetry**: Real-time "Sensor Data" readouts including TEMP, FLOW, and GPS coordinates during the mixing process.
*   **Status Terminal**: A CLI-style "Timeline" that logs every action in your mixology sequence.

## 🎨 Aesthetic Guidelines

Liquid Art follows a strict **Retro-Industrial Pixel** aesthetic:
*   **Typography**: *Silkscreen* for UI elements, *Press Start 2P* for high-impact headers.
*   **Resolution**: Intentionally low-res SVG geometry to maintain the "stepped" look.
*   **Color Palette**: High-contrast, vibrant neons against a deep slate industrial background.
